# Diabetes-Prediction-using-R
This repository is a basic and simple demonstration of how to perform null hypothesis test and build a simple logistic regression model. If you are new to the Data Science you will need to have a good grasp of Statistical Modelling and this repository helps you get going with it.

This is the project we did for our Statistics using R course where we used Kaggle Dataset to train our model to predict Diabetes.

For the final project we came up with different hypothesis and tested them by calculating the p-value. The code demonstrates the steps to calculate p-value however, the hypothesis can be arbitrary.

We also performed univariate and multivariate analysis. Finding correlation between independent variables.

We build various models using interaction terms and evaluated their performances. Our final model was picked by looking at metrices such as R-square and AIC(Akaike information criterion) which tells us how well the model was able to capture the variance in the dataset and also will be penalized if it is too complicated respectively.

We also visualize our dataset to get a picture of how different variables have an impact on our target variable.

For detailed explanation plese refer to the R code of the repository and the ppt.
